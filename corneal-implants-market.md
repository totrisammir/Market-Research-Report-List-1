<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Corneal Implants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intracorneal Ring Segments(ICRS)</li><li>Keratoprosthesis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The corneal implants market comprises various types, including Intracorneal Ring Segments (ICRS) and Keratoprosthesis. ICRS are designed to correct refractive errors by flattening the cornea and improving vision, making them suitable for patients with keratoconus or other corneal irregularities. Keratoprosthesis, on the other hand, is a synthetic corneal implant used to restore vision in patients with severe corneal damage or disease who are unsuitable for conventional corneal transplants. Both types enhance visual outcomes and provide alternatives to traditional surgical options.</p></p>
