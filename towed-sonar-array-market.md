<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Towed Sonar Array Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Sensor</li><li>Active Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The towed sonar array market consists of two primary types: passive sensors and active sensors. Passive sensors detect sounds from underwater objects, such as submarines or marine life, without emitting signals, making them stealthy. In contrast, active sensors emit sonar waves and analyze the echoes that return, providing detailed information about the environment and potential threats. Both types are crucial for naval defense, research, and fishing industries, offering distinct advantages depending on operational requirements and scenarios.</p></p>
