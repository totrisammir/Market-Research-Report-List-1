<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tidal Current Generator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Power Generation</li><li>Vertical Power Generation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The tidal current generator market is primarily divided into two types: horizontal power generation and vertical power generation. Horizontal power generation systems utilize horizontal-axis turbines, capturing energy from tidal flow with blades rotating perpendicular to the water current. Conversely, vertical power generation systems employ vertical-axis turbines, leveraging water movement through blades aligned parallel to the current. Both technologies harness tidal energy to produce electricity but differ in design and efficiency, tailored to specific marine environments and energy requirements.</p></p>
