<p><strong>The Nuclear Decommissioning Services Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Immediate Dismantling</li><li>Deferred Dismantling</li><li>Entombment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Nuclear Decommissioning Services Market comprises three primary applications: Immediate Dismantling, Deferred Dismantling, and Entombment. Immediate Dismantling involves the prompt removal and disposal of nuclear facility components after shutdown, ensuring rapid site restoration. Deferred Dismantling allows for a waiting period before decommissioning to let radiation levels decrease naturally, facilitating safer dismantling. Entombment involves encapsulating the facility in a structurally sound material, isolating radioactive materials from the environment, often used when immediate removal isn't feasible or cost-effective.</p></p>
